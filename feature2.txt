Problem:
I used "git rebase main" to bring the changes on main into dev_f2.
However, Git blocks the push because the local history has been rewritten during the rebase process.

Solution:
I suppose this branch only belongs to me and I know what I am doing.
So I used "git push --force" to push to the remote.
